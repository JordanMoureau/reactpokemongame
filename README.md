#Pokemon Math Game | PokeMath

PokeMath is a game built for my kids to learn math. My son asked me to build him a game where he could evolve his pokemons. He's been struggling with math a bit in school so I decided to make him a math game. The web app helps kids learn addition, subtraction and multiplication. 

##Project Description

The game level can be set to easy, medium or hard which defines which operator is placed between the two randomly generated numbers between 1 and 12. If the answer logged in the input field is correct then the 8bit pokemon gif changes to the next evolution of the pokemon selected. When you reach the end of the pokemon's evolution a congrats message appears along with a reset button. You can change the level of the game at any point to switch out the math problem.

##Technologies Used

It was built with React, HTML and CSS.

##Challenges

There were three big road blocks for me when building this project:

1. Selecting the pokemon from the side bar
2. Going from data based to randomly generated numbers
3. Accessing current render of random intergers to calcuate the correct answer


## Using the Project
Type in your name, select a difficulty and submit. Choose a pokemon to evolve, solve the math problem until you've evolved three stages. Reset if you'd like to play again. Change the level by clicking on the yellow level button. Click the arrow to slide up or down the pokemon side bar.
